# Burned-Area-Mapping
The repository contains information and code about mapping agriculture residue burned area. The code is prepared by considering the study area as Indian State, Punjab.

The study is divided into four different objectives. 
1)Backscatter analysis for rice mapping
2)Rice mapping
3)Sensitivity analysis for burned area mapping
4)Earth engine application for mapping agriculture residue burned area

Codes for the separate objectives are given in the folder 'Code'

Data in the 'Data' folder are in .geojson, zip formats. These files have to be uploaded as GEE asset and should be imported while running the code.

All the codes in 'code' folder are written in Google Earth Engine Code Editor.

Initially rice is mapped in this project and that rice layer is further used for crop residue burned area analysis. Reference paper used for writing the code is given in the folder 'docs' folder.
