# Burned-Area-Mapping
The repository contains information and code about mapping agriculture residue burned area. The code is prepared by considering the study area as Indian State, Punjab.

Data in the 'data' folder are water, trees, buildings points mapped from Google earth imagery and stored as .geojson format. These files have to be uploaded as GEE asset and imported while running the code.

All the codes in 'code' folder are written in Google Earth Engine Code Editor.

Initially rice is mapped in this project and that rice layer is further used for crop residue burned area analysis. The code and reference paper used for writing the code is also given in the folders 'code' and 'doc' folders respectively.
