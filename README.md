**Mapping agricultural residue burns in Punjab**

The repository contains information and codes about mapping agriculture residue burned areas.

The study is divided into four different sections. 
1)Backscatter analysis for rice mapping
2)Rice mapping
3)Creating a Google Earth engine application for mapping agricultural residue burned areas

Codes for the separate objectives are given in the folder 'Code'.

Data in the 'Data' folder are in .geojson, zip formats. These files have to be uploaded as GEE assets and should be imported while running the code.

All the codes in the 'code' folder are written in Google Earth Engine Code Editor.

Initially, rice is mapped in this project, and that rice layer is further used for crop residue burned area analysis. The reference papers are given in the 'docs' folder.
